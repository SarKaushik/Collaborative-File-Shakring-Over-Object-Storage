In this role, I executed a Collaborative File Sharing Over Object Storage
project, which leveraged object storage to create interactive tools and
platforms.
• Utilized ASP.NET 2.0, SQL Server, and Visual Studio to design and launch
an interactive file sharing website that minimized web refreshes. Used an
advanced AES-encryption algorithm to optimize system security and
accessibility.
• Implemented object storage to roll out a cloud-based file sharing system.
• Cut overloading of cloud resources and propelled cloud efficiency by 25%.
• Catapulted data retrieval by 12%, achieved scalability, and reduced
limitations.
• Accomplished $1K in cost savings through the testing and analysis of more
than 32 program modules.
